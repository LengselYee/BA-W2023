# Python References

If you encounter any problem in Python, you may refer to the reference book [Python for Data Analysis (2nd Edition)](https://github.com/DSME-6756-23/BA-W2022/blob/main/Python%20References/Python%20for%20Data%20Analysis%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf). Alternatively, you can just Google your issue/question/confusion.
